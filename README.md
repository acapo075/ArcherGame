Simple run game 

You can run the application with Android Studio.

Hello there. I’m here today to show you my Android studio project. I decided to design a mobile game for Android.  It’s a small game without an end, where you run toward multiple enemies and kill them, an endless runner for the one who knows the genre. 

Here is the Main menu with three button.

The first one is called “about”, this is where the story of your character is.

Next one is the “High score” button, here you will find the top 4 score that was achieved on your device. Here is the highest I have achieved. I cheated a little but I bet that you could do way better.

And finally here is the “play now” button, this will start a new game. When you press the button the game will start again.
The goal is to go as far as possible without touching any enemies. By pressing the right side of the screen you can shoot arrow to eliminate enemies but beware because you have limited arrows in your quiver. To get more you will need to jump in the air to grab some more. To jump you need to press the left side of the screen. 

There is two type of ennemies, the first one is the golem. It is the big red enemy  which move a little slower. There is also a witch which is the smaller white enemy, this one is faster.

If you are touch by the enemy you will die. Your character will stop moving and after a little wait you will see a game over and then you will be back on the main menu.

So here’s my game and I hope that you like it.
